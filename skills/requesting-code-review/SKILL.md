# Requesting Code Review

Request review early to catch issues before they spread.

## When

- After completing a plan task or batch
- After major refactor/feature work
- Before merge or PR finalization

## How

1. Determine review range (`BASE_SHA` -> `HEAD_SHA`). Getting this wrong silently reviews the wrong thing:
   - **Whole branch:** `BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)` (substitute your default branch). **Not** a bare `origin/main` — once main moves past your branch point, main's newer files appear in the diff as phantom deletions your branch never made, and the reviewer spends its pass on them.
   - **A single task or batch:** the commit recorded *before* the work started. **Not** `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last commit of a multi-commit task.
   - No remote, or `origin/main` not fetched: fall back to `git merge-base main HEAD`.
   - Confirm the range is non-empty before dispatching — `git diff --stat BASE..HEAD`. An empty range produces a confident "no issues found" review of nothing.
2. Check for `context-snapshot.json` at the project root:
   - If present: run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to `git_hash` in the file.
     - **Hashes match (fresh):** use `changed_files` and `blast_radius` as the review scope. Inject this summary into the code-reviewer prompt: *"Changed files: [list]. Also referenced by: [blast_radius callers]."*
     - **Hashes differ (stale):** note the snapshot is from a previous commit; use `changed_files` as a starting point but do not rely on `blast_radius`.
   - If absent: determine scope from `git diff --name-only BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA` directly.

   **What `blast_radius` means.** Each entry lists files containing a reference that *resolves* to the changed file's path — a relative import, or the repo path written out. It is deliberately incomplete: references that cannot be resolved (package-style imports, dynamic paths, aliases from `tsconfig`) are dropped rather than guessed, so an empty list means "nothing was proven," not "nothing depends on this." Never widen review scope on a name match alone; if you need dependents the snapshot does not list, grep for them and say you did.

   `blast_radius_method` records how the edges were derived. If it is missing, the snapshot came from a version that matched basenames as words — ignore `blast_radius` entirely and scope from the diff.
3. If a plan is in play, write the diff to a file first: `bash ../subagent-driven-development/scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD`. It refuses empty and non-descendant ranges outright, so the reviewer never receives a range that cannot mean what it claims. Pass the printed path to the reviewer.
4. Dispatch `superpowers-optimized:code-reviewer` using `requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md`.
5. Provide:
   - What changed (from context snapshot or git diff)
   - Scoped file list (changed files + blast radius callers if fresh snapshot available, or broad if not)
   - Requirement or plan reference
   - SHA range
   - Short summary

## Security Review (Built-In)

When changes touch security-relevant areas, the code review **must** include a security pass. This is not a separate step — it's part of every review where applicable.

**Triggers automatically when changes touch:**
- Authentication or authorization flows
- Input validation or output encoding
- API endpoints handling user data
- Secrets management or credential handling
- Cryptography, key management, or token generation
- Infrastructure, deployment, or CI/CD configs

**Security checklist:**
- OWASP Top 10 and CWE vulnerability scan
- OWASP API Security Top 10: broken object/function-level authorization, unrestricted resource consumption, SSRF, mass assignment, improper inventory management
- Input validation and injection risk (SQL, XSS, CSRF, command injection)
- Auth flow correctness (session handling, token expiry, privilege escalation, rate limiting on auth endpoints)
- Secrets handling (no hardcoded credentials, proper env var usage)
- Dependency vulnerabilities (known CVEs in imported packages)
- API hardening (security headers, CORS configuration, error message sanitization, rate limiting)
- Logging hygiene (no secrets in logs, adequate audit trail)

**Severity enforcement:**
- Critical/High security findings **block merge** until addressed or the user explicitly accepts the risk with documented rationale.
- Medium security findings should be fixed before merge unless explicitly deferred.

## Adversarial Checks (Built-In)

The single code reviewer checks correctness, security where applicable, and concrete failure scenarios. Include adversarial checks relevant to the changed code: specific edge-case inputs, race conditions, invalid state transitions, retry/recovery failures, and resource exhaustion. Do these checks within the same review; do not dispatch another agent for them.

## Separate Red Team (Explicit Request Only)

Dispatch `superpowers-optimized:red-team` only when the user explicitly requests a separate red-team assessment. Complex logic, concurrency, state management, or critical data paths alone do not authorize a second agent.

When requested, the red team provides an independent adversarial assessment. Its Critical findings block merge alongside security Critical findings.

## Auto-Fix Pipeline

When the red team report contains Critical or High findings, run the auto-fix pipeline. The pipeline is **ASI-guided and iterative** — fix one finding at a time, starting from the red team's designated ASI, then re-assess before proceeding. This prevents fixes from conflicting with each other when findings touch shared code.

**Iteration loop:**

1. **Identify the entry point.** Start with the finding marked **ASI** in the red team summary. If no ASI is marked, start with the highest-severity finding.
2. **Write the failing test.** Flesh out the test skeleton from the red team report into a real test and run it. It MUST fail — this proves the scenario is real. If the test passes, the finding was a false positive; skip it and note it in the triage, then re-identify the next ASI.
3. **Fix the code.** Make the minimum change to pass the test. Do not refactor or improve surrounding code.
4. **Run a targeted re-check.** Re-read only the files touched by the fix and check whether: (a) the fix introduced any new issues, and (b) any previously reported findings are now resolved as a side effect.
5. **Re-assess the remaining findings.** Update your list — remove resolved findings, re-prioritize if the fix changed the risk landscape. Identify the new ASI.
6. **Repeat** from step 2 until no Critical or High findings remain.

**After the loop completes:**
- Run one final regression check covering everything the fixes touched, scoped per
  `verification-before-completion`. Fixes confined to one module: that module's suite plus its
  dependents. Fixes spanning modules or touching a shared contract: the full suite.
- Report: findings fixed, false positives skipped, any regressions introduced and resolved.

**Skip conditions:**
- If the red team report has zero Critical/High findings, skip the pipeline entirely.
- Medium findings are tracked for later, not auto-fixed.
- If the user explicitly says to skip auto-fix, respect that.

## Triage Rules

- Fix all Critical issues before proceeding.
- Fix Important issues unless user explicitly defers.
- Track Minor issues for later.
- Push back with evidence when feedback is incorrect.

## Output Requirement

Review must include severity, file references, security findings (if applicable), and merge readiness verdict.
